“C-Media Electronics, Inc. CM108 Audio Controller” is the USB mini microphone. Check the microphone with arecord

arecord -l

(“l” is lower “L”). You will see the recording device：

Step3: Records testing

Record for three seconds and play it

arecord -D plughw:1,0 -d 3.0 test.wav && aplay test.wav

Mk6.jpg

Here we use arecord to record and aplay to play;“-D” to choose the device and “-d” to set the recording time

You can input “arecord --help” and “aplay --help” for details.

If the sound is low, you can adjust the gain of the microphone.

Step4: Adjust the gain of the microphone

Open the Audio Device Settings: Open the Menu in the top left corner, and go through Preferences => Audio Device Settings.
